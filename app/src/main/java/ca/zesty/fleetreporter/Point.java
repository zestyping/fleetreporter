/** A data class for reporting location information about a tracked entity.

    At any given moment in time, a tracked entity is considered to be in a
    "resting" state or a "moving" state.  A "segment" is a period of continuous
    rest or continuous movement; a new segment begins at each state transition.

    The period of time from lastTransitionMillis to fix.timeMillis is the
    segment leading up to this Point (lastTransitionMillis <= fix.timeMillis).

    A "resting point" indicates that the entity is resting both before and after.
    A "moving point" indicates that the entity is moving both before and after.
    A "go point" is a transition from resting to moving.
    A "stop point" is a transition from moving to resting.

    The semantics of the times in a Point are as follows:
      - All timestamps are in GPS time.
      - As sent to the server, the timestamp is precise only to whole seconds.
      - The timestamp in whole seconds is to be treated as a unique key.
      - A point with a given timestamp overrides any points previously
        received by the server with the same timestamp.
      - A resting point overrides any points previously received by the server
        that have timestamps between lastTransitionMillis and timeMillis.
